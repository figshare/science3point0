Excited about online science? How can you help.


-We'd love you to see if your scientific software or coding can be implemented into the site.

-We'd love to have any web 2.0 or 3.0 software running on the site that isnt already.

-We'd love to have any current plugins developed to make them more relevant for online science.

-We'd love to have the theme customised further to make it more user friendly, or just prettier.


Any customised logos, or adaptations of the current logo would be awesome.


...and we'd love to hear about any other mods you can think of.


Cheers.
